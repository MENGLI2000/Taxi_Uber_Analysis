# Taxi_Uber_Analysis
## 1. Introduction

This project uses Python and SQL queries to answer particular questions by downloading and cleaning data, storing the data in a SQLite database, and providing analysis and visualizations, using hired-ride trip data from Uber and NYC Yellow cab from January 2009 through June 2015, and joining with local historical weather data.
